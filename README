Here i assume the data that will be sent by the transmitter is
MTI : its type BCD 
BITMAP : its type HEX
Data fields:
ANSI TYPE data element is HEX
other than that is BCD

example:
iso8583 msg = "080020200000008000000000000000013239313130303031"
after parsing
MTI = 800
TID = 29110001
STAN = 1
PRIVATE USE = TEST MESSG
NETWORK MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CODE = 301
